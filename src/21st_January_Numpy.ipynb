    "The np.reshape function in NumPy is used to change the shape of an array without changing its data. It allows you to modify the dimensions of the array, either by adding or removing dimensions, or by changing the number of elements in each dimension.<br>\n",
    "Here's a summary of the key points regarding the np.reshape function and its usage:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality: The np.reshape function is used to modify the shape of an array without changing its data. It takes the original array as the first argument and the desired shape as the second argument, specified as a list or tuple. If the shape does not match the number of elements in the original array, a ValueError occurs.<br>\n",

    "Usage: The function can be used to convert a 1D array into a 2D array, or to change the dimensions of a multi-dimensional array. For example, reshaping a 1D array with 12 elements into a 2D array with 4 arrays, each with 3 elements, can be achieved using arr.reshape(4, 3).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Determination of Dimensions: The np.reshape function also allows for the automatic determination of dimensions. For example, reshaping an array with an unknown number of columns into a new array with 3 rows and an unknown number of columns can be achieved by passing the arguments (3, -1) to the np.reshape function. The -1 argument indicates that NumPy should automatically determine the number of columns based on the total number of elements in the array.<br>\n",

    "Ordering: The function also supports specifying the order of the reshaping process, such as C-contiguous or Fortran-contiguous order in memory, which affects the index ordering for fetching and placing the values into the output array.<br>\n",
    "The np.reshape function is a versatile tool for reshaping arrays in NumPy, providing flexibility in modifying the dimensions and structure of arrays to suit specific requirements.<br>"

    "Broadcasting in NumPy refers to the ability of NumPy to treat arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. This allows for element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes, making it possible to perform operations even when the shapes of the arrays are not exactly the same.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key points about broadcasting in NumPy are as follows:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Different Shapes: Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays with different shapes. If the arrays have exactly the same shape, the operations are performed smoothly. However, if the dimensions of the arrays are dissimilar, element-to-element operations are not possible. Broadcasting allows the smaller array to be broadcast to the size of the larger array so that they have compatible shapes.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules for Broadcasting: Broadcasting is possible if certain rules are satisfied. These rules include the smaller array being prepended with '1' in its shape, and the dimensions of the arrays being compatible for element-wise operations.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Efficient Vectorized Operations: Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations, allowing for efficient algorithm implementations. It avoids making needless copies of data and leads to efficient computation by performing operations in C instead of Python.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Examples: Broadcasting is commonly used in various scenarios, such as performing arithmetic operations on arrays with different sizes, and in cases where the shapes of the arrays are not similar.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Overall, broadcasting in NumPy is a powerful feature that enables efficient and flexible handling of arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations, providing a high level of flexibility and convenience in array computations.\n",
